# Therapy-Adherence-Patient-Engagement-Analytics-Power-BI-Project-
This project analyzes patient therapy adherence and engagement using historical session-level healthcare data. I built a structured analytics layer to track patient progression, adherence rates, drop-off points, and cohort behavior across therapy programs. Using SQL, Python, and BI dashboards, raw clinical data was transformed into clear metrics and insights, enabling healthcare, product, and operations teams to identify risk areas, improve engagement, and support data-driven clinical and business decisions.
